<h1 align="left">Building a Typing Game</h1>

My game is going to test a player's typing skill, which is one of the most underrated skills all developers should have. We should all be practicing our typing! 


<h2>Objective </h2>
The general flow of the game will look like this:

Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type.
Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox.
As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted.
If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red.
When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time.

<h2>Result</h2>
